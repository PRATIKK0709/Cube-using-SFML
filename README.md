# Cube-using-SFML

This C++ program uses the SFML library to create an interactive 3D rotating cube visualization. The cube rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, and you can toggle the rotation direction by pressing the Space key. The cube's edges are displayed in white against a black background. You can exit the program by pressing the Escape key. This code provides a basic example of interactive 3D graphics using keyboard input for control.
